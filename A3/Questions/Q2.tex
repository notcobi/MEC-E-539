\textit{Approximate the convective term of the obtained equation using
the upwind scheme.}
For upwind scheme with east as positive flow direction,
\begin{align*}
    \hat{T}_w &= \hat{T}_W \\
    \hat{T}_e &= \hat{T}_P 
\end{align*}
Then, the convective term becomes,
\begin{align*}
    \text{Convective} &= \hat{T}_e - \hat{T}_w \\
    &= \boxed{\hat{T}_P - \hat{T}_W}
\end{align*}
