moment arm is to calculate torque and efficiency later

The sensitivity of the pressure transducer is $\qty{5}{\psi\per\volt}$.

A stroboscope was used to verify the RPM of the pump. At 1800 RPM, the stroboscope reading was 1798.

\underline{Why is the pressure of the pump outlet measured further ahead than the pressure of the pump inlet?}

The flow right out of the pump is turbulent, so the pressure head is not fully developed. Some distance away from the outlet, the flow becomes fully developed.

\underline{How does the equation for head change if the configuration is in parallel and series?}
For parallel, the head of both paths are averaged. For series, the head of both paths are added.
\begin{align*}
    H_{t, \text{parallel}} &= \frac{\Delta P_{A} + \Delta P_{B}}{2 \rho g} \\
    H_{t, \text{series}} &= \frac{\Delta P_{A} + \Delta P_{B}}{\rho g}
\end{align*}
