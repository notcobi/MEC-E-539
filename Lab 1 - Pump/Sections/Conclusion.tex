\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent The calibration section of the lab highlighted important concepts such as quantization, the trade-off between resolution and range, and the importance 
of a known reference voltage. The Arduino Uno was used to measure the voltage across different circuit components and reference voltages, and their 
impact on resolution, accuracy, and range was observed. The time varying voltage section of the lab highlighted the importance of sampling rate and 
resolution. Hands-on experience with an oscilloscope was obtained, and measurements were compared to the Arduino Uno. The Arduino Uno was able to
somewhat agree with the much more expensive oscilloscope. Increasing the sample rate and resolution of the Arduino Uno would allow for better agreement
with the oscilloscope.
