\section{Introduction}

\noindent The primary objective of this lab is to investigate and familiarize elements of digital measurements such as 
word length (number of bits), quantization, resolution, conversion rates, sampling, accuracy, and signal conditioning through the use of an Arduino Uno. 
These concepts are important in signal processing and digital communications and familiarity with them is important for future development.
