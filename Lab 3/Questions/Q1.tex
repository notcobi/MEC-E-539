% The flow past a circular cylinder generates a vortex street that is known as the Von K´arm´an
% Vortex Street. In this lab, we will simulate the steady state solution of this vortex shedding phenomenon based on a laminar flow of air at 25◦C over a 2D circular cylinder. The
% schematics of the problem is shown in Figure 1, where the cylinder diameter (D) is 10 mm,
% the free stream velocity is U∞ = 0.24 m/s

% PART I. Problem Setup
% The first step in setting up a computational simulation is to understand the problem and
% calculate important parameters. Then, the problem is replicated by designing a correct CAD
% model that is used for mesh generation. This is followed by assigning boundary conditions
% and initial conditions to solve the Navier-Stokes equation.
% Considering the setup in Figure 1, complete the following tasks:
% Task 1.1. Calculate the problem Reynolds number (Re = U∞D/ν) and confirm that the
% flow is laminar.
% Task 1.2. Open ANSYS Workbench and define a new project based on ANSYS Fluent.
% Task 1.3. Generate a CAD model for dimensions and the simulation setup discussed above
% (i.e., Figure 1) using ANSYS Design Modeler.
% Task 1.4. Generate a moderately fine mesh for the geometry built in the previous step.
% The minimum element length is D/5, which should be labeled “Grid 1”. You should place
% 5 Prism Layers (Inflation Layers) around the cylinder at a “Transition Ratio” of 0.25, and
% “Growth Rate” of 1.2.
% Task 1.5. In ANSYS Fluent, assign the relevant boundary conditions to the domain as it
% has been described in Figure 1. The outlet boundary condition is “Outlet” with a relative
% “Gauge Pressure” of 0 atm.
% Task 1.6. The convergence threshold residual should be set at 10−4
% . The lower this value,
% more accurate the simulations are and more computational resources to complete the simulations.
% Task 1.7. Under “Monitors”, set a “Report Plot” for plotting drag force applying on the
% cylinder against number of iterations. Note that the drag force needs to be defined in “Report
% Definitions” before being set.
% Task 1.8. Assign the standard initialization of ux = 0, uy = 0, and pg = 0 (gauge pressure)
% to the entire domain.
% % Task 1.9. The maximum number of iterations recommended is 1000.
% Based on the setup from PART I, complete the following task:
% Task 2.1. Complete the simulation of laminar flow of air over a 2D circular cylinder using
% “Grid 1”. The pressure-velocity coupling scheme should be set as “Coupled”. Spatial discretization methods for pressure and momentum should be second order accurate. You can
% change the solver method under Solution in ANSYS Fluent.
% Task 2.2. Once the simulation is complete, proceed to ANSYS CFD-Post for post-processing
% of the data. Obtain or calculate the following:
% (I) Calculate the Mean Drag Force (force acting in the x−direction) acting on the cylinder.
% (II) Calculate the Mean Drag Coefficient (Cd = FD/(0.5ρU2
% ∞D)) for the cylinder.
% (III) Draw the plot of mean streamwise (x−direction) velocity (u) along the wake centerline
% (the horizontal line that starts at the center of the cylinder and extends to the end of the
% computational domain - only in the x−direction). Note the x−location at which this
% line crosses zero for the first time. This is referred to as the “Mean Recirculation Length”
% (Lr). Normalize this number using the problem characteristic length, which is the
% cylinder diameter (D).
% (IV) Create a contour plot of mean pressure (p) in the wake. Adjust the values of maximum
% and minimum pressure so that the recirculation vortex is distinguishable from the flow.
% (V) Has the solution converged? Do you believe that the results illustrate a steady state
% solution of the wake? Please justify your answer.
% NOTE: The extent of the recirculation (mean) vortex in the x−direction, which was identified by the contour plot of pressure, should be identical to the value of Lr.
% PART III. Grid Independence Analysis
% Task 3.1. Create a new case in ANSYS Workbench called “Grid 2” and changed the
% minimum mesh size to D/10 ≈ 1 mm. You should place at least 10 Prism Grid around the
% cylinder. Then, redo all tasks and complete the simulations. Re-generate all the plots and
% calculations from Task 2.2 for “Grid 2”.
% Task 3.2. Create two more case in ANSYS Workbench “Grid 3” and “Grid 4” using ANSYS
% Fluent and change the minimum mesh size to D/15 ≈ 0.667 mm and D/20 ≈ 0.5 mm.
% Complete the simulations and re-generate all the plots and calculations from Task 2.2 for
% “Grid 3” and “Grid 4”.
% Task 3.3. Create a table that includes the number of elements (n), coefficient of drag (Cd),
% the mean recirculation length (Lr), and their percentage of change with respect to “Grid 1”.
% 3
% Comment on how they differ for the four grids. Which grid should be used for simulating
% this laminar flow? Why? Please justify your answer.
% NOTE: This process is commonly referred to as the “Grid Independence Analysis”. The
% final selected grid will be used for the main simulation and to obtain results.

\section*{Part I. Problem Setup}
\subsection*{Task 1.1}
\textit{Calculate the problem Reynolds number (Re = $U_\infty D/\nu$) and confirm that the flow is laminar.}

The working fluid is air. The properties of air at 25°C and 1 atm are taken from a textbook \cite{Cengel2017-jf}.
\begin{align*}
    \rho &= 1.184 \text{ kg/m}^3 \\
    \mu &= 1.562 \times 10^{-5} \text{ kg/ms} \\
    \nu &= \frac{\mu}{\rho} = 1.318 \times 10^{-5} \text{ m}^2/\text{s}
\end{align*}

The Reynolds number is calculated as
\begin{align*}
    \text{Re} &= \frac{U_\infty D}{\nu} \\
    &= \frac{0.24  \times 0.1}{1.318 \times 10^{-5}} \\
    &= 1820.9
\end{align*}
This is less than the critical Reynolds number of 2000, so the flow is laminar.

\subsection*{Task 1.3}
\textit{Generate a CAD model for dimensions and the simulation setup discussed above (i.e., Figure 1) using ANSYS Design Modeler.}
