\textit{Solve the simplified momentum equation.}

\subsection*{Solution}
Using no-slip boundary conditions, the boundary conditions are 
\begin{align*}
    u_x(0) &= 0 \\
    u_x(H) &= u_w
\end{align*}

The simplified momentum equation in the $x$-direction is given by
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2} &= 0
\end{align*}
which has the general solution
\begin{align*}
    u_x(y) &= A y + B
\end{align*}
where $A$ and $B$ are constants. Applying the boundary conditions, we find
\begin{align*}
    u_x(0) &= B = 0 \\
    u_x(H) &= A H = u_w
\end{align*}
which gives
\begin{align*}
    u_x(y) &= \frac{u_w}{H} y
\end{align*}
This linear profile is also known as Couette flow. Next, the simplified momentum equation in the $y$-direction is given by
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} &= 0
\end{align*}
which has the general solution
\begin{align*}
    P &= C(z)
\end{align*}
where $C(z)$ is a function of $z$. Lastly, the simplified momentum equation in the $z$-direction is given by
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} &= -\rho g
\end{align*}
which has the general solution
\begin{align*}
    P(z) &= -\rho g z + D
\end{align*}
where $D$ is a constant.

So in summary, 
\begin{empheq}[box=\fbox]{align*}
    \vec{u} &= \left[\frac{u_w}{H} y\right] \hat{i} \\
    P &= -\rho g z + D
\end{empheq}
