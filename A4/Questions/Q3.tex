\section{Conclusions}
did mesh refinement by guessing an initial element size and halving it 5 times. then drag coefficient was calcualted for each mesh as well as contours and streamlines to view the flow characteristics. mesh iondependece was performed. then convergence was calcualted and tested to see hte order of convergence which should've been second order since second order mthods were used but that was not the case
